A quick self paced course: https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github


This project will be an opportunity for you to refresh skills on GitHub, and practice version control.
The project will evolve over time, and - as you add elements or layers of complexity, you will 'fork' or create versions, 
where the original working version will be the main 'branch' and other versions will be in test until you merge' them together.

### Step 1 - Play the Lemonade Stand Game on CoolMathGames.com (you may have to try a couple machines)

  As you play - pay attention to the kind of information that is asked of you the player, and imagine how things might be working 'behind the scenes'.
  
### Step 2 - Draw It!  Draw out a series of Text Screens that you imagine will be required.

  - Recommend Using Notability or similar screen - thinking about steps of the game.  
  - Question: what controls the game experience?  The User or the Software?  Are you in control of the game?  Or only elements?
  - Consider why this is important to how you design the game.
